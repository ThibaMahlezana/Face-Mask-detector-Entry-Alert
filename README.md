# ðŸ˜· Face-Mask-detector-Entry-Alert

Due to covid-19 Pandemic where people where adviced to wear masks and keep social distancing to contain the virus, I have decided to make a python application to enforce that.
This is a system to detect people if they are wearing mask or not on the entry point.
The system sounds the buzzer if it detected someone not wearing a mask.

# Requirements

- Numpy
- PyQt5
- OpenCV4
- Pygame
- Imutils

# How to run the program

Just run the "main.py" file on your terminal after you have installed the packages listed above.

# ðŸ˜· Face-Mask-detector-Entry-Alert

## About the Project
The Mask Detection System is a Python application built with OpenCV and PyQt5 that monitors entry points to ensure compliance with mask-wearing guidelines. Utilizing real-time facial recognition technology, the system detects whether individuals are wearing masks. If a person is detected without a mask, the system triggers a buzzer alert.

## Motivation
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it became essential to enforce health guidelines such as mask-wearing and social distancing. This project aims to create a practical solution for public spaces, enhancing safety measures by automating the detection of mask compliance.

## Requirements
To run this application, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV4
- PyQt5
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 2.X
- Pygame
- Imutils

  You can install the required libraries using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
